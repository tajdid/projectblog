		<p>Colours play an important role in all design mediums. Although the visual functionality of a website is influenced primarily by the text on the screen and page layout, colour takes it a step further by making a psychological impact (Irby, 2014).</p>

<p>Mark Boulton reports that designing with colour in graphic design is the most difficult to get right (Boulton, 2014). I completely agree with this statement  as colour is very subjective. Some like a combination of green and blue, whereas some find it boring.</p>

<p>Choosing the right colours when designing a website is something that requires a lot of patience, experimentation and guesswork.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People make a subconscious judgment about a product in less than 90 seconds of viewing, and a majority of these people base that assessment on color alone. In fact, almost 85% of consumers cite color as the primary reason they buy a particular product, and 80% of people believe color increases brand recognition. (Gillett, 2014)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any professional web designer would be able to tell you that there are three properties to colour - hue, saturation and value;</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hue</strong> - what part of the spectrum the colour belongs to (such as red, yellow, pink, green, purple, orange or blue).</li>
  <li><strong>Saturation</strong> - how rich a hue is; neon colours, for example, are very saturated, whilst pastel ones are less so.</li>
  <li><strong>Value</strong> - how bright a color is; really, it is looking at how close it is to white or black.</li>
</ul>

<p>The property that many people mistakenly use is the hue, as they tend to choose colors that clash together instead of flowing nice.</p>

<p><em>Figure 1: Colour wheel image found <a href="http://barbiemutation.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/color-wheel-madness.html">here</a></em></p>

<p>Just take a look at the colour wheel (figure 1) here. It looks nice and the colours flow perfectly into one another — so it goes without saying that visually, blue, and the colours to the left and right of it, blend nicely together. They’re called analogous colours.</p>
