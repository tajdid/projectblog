		<h1>Composition in Web Design</h1>

	<section>
		<p>Composition is about how ideas and design elements are laid out into a whole, composing a design. It is arguably the most important part of a design process.</p>

<p>Good composition will boost the user experience when navigating through a website and will help create a better design overall. When creating composition, the designer should aim for alignment, consistency and strong unity. Composition also helps to add visual relevance to layouts so that it can help users to understand more about their journey on a website, where they should head next.</p>

<p>A layout is the basis of a website. It brings different aspects of design into play and guides the user through each section and tells them what is most important. With different browser types, screen resolutions and sizes a designer needs to know what layout to use whether it is fixed, fluid or responsive. In this post I will talk about different aspects of layout used in web design.</p>

<h2 id="spatial-relationships">Spatial Relationships</h2>

<p>Space is an important part of web design, but it’s also one of the most neglected and underrated. By being able to grasp control of negative/white space, we are able to create a subtle, but defining element of a webpage and make good use of it.</p>

<p>Negative/white space is when an area of a design which doesn’t demand our attention.</p>

<h2 id="grid-systems">Grid Systems</h2>

<p>Whenever I’m working on website I use a grid system as they are crucial to good web design. Whether I’m using my own prebuilt, responsive, CSS-based grid system or designing around guides in Photoshop, grids provide structure and clarity to web design. </p>

<p>Grids have been used for centuries in print design. They have helped rein in the chaos of the web as well—time was, web pages were built with lots of nested tables and spacer gifs. This was not the best solution, but once CSS became more popular and supported, designers were quick to use grids in their designs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“When you add complexity, you can decrease usability and there is a danger the grid would become so complex the designer can’t use it.”</em> - Boulton (Designing for the Web (Online, 2014), Chapter 5, Part 23)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="rule-of-thirds">Rule of Thirds</h2>

<p>I was first made aware of the rule of thirds whilst working on my final GCSE art project. At first I didn’t think much of it, but once I saw it in practice I was simply amazed how it transformed the way I viewed art. The rules of thirds is commonly associated with art and photography, but it can also be applied to web design.</p>

<p>The rule of thirds is a essentially a guideline that is used when creating designs, photographs, films and paintings. The rule of thirds uses a grid of 3x3, hence the name, which can placed on any design, photography and painting which can help the user to alter their work to make them more appealing to the viewer or audience. It is used to help balance designs and work and make them more interesting and eye catching to the viewer.</p>

<p>The Golden Ratio is a grid system that helps designers/developers plan their websites or designs to help improve user satisfaction or appear more aesthetically pleasing to the human eye. The ratio does not strictly have to be similar to figure X above, it can be adapted. Twitter (as shown in figure X below) have flipped it to fit for their design and information to make it look better and easy to use.</p>
