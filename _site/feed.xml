        <title>Storyboarding</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I designed the homepage design below using Adobe Photoshop. We didn’t have any brand guidelines given to us, so I had the creative freedom to execute the design however I wanted. I decided to go with a black and green colour scheme. The black colour gives it a corporate theme and the green is meant to represent Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried putting focus on the content so I didn’t use any gradients, but used photography along with some simple and clean typography.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Concept Creation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a group we decided to create a wireframe of the homepage. We’ll each be creating our own version of the homepage and we’ll then be translating this into a pixel perfect mockup later using Adobe Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created the wireframe below using a program called &lt;a href=&quot;http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/&quot;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt;, which is great for user interface design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CPS Workshop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The problems I looked at were ‘Logo Creation’ and ‘Domain Name’. I used mind maps to find my solutions, which see below in figures 1 and 2.

&lt;p&gt;Alec Devlin used a brainstorming method to discuss and find solutions for his problems which were ‘Web hosting’ and ‘Lack of communication with the client’. You can see his brainstorming method below in figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren used the 6-3-5 brainstorming method for her problems, which were ‘Colour Scheme’ and ‘Layout’. You can see her solution below in figure 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I really enjoyed the creative problem solving workshop. It allowed us to think more effectively and has created solutions that we never knew existed before.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Creative Problem Solving</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Creative problem solving is a way of addressing an issue in a creative way. This technique allows us to think differently, excercise our minds, redefine the problem we’re facing, find new ideas and then take suitable action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;divergent--convergent-thinking&quot;&gt;Divergent &amp;amp; Convergent Thinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divergent and Convergent are two types of thinking that are equally important in brainstorming and collaboration. The first, &lt;em&gt;divergent thinking&lt;/em&gt; is considered “thinking out the box” where the imagination runs wild and possibilities are endless.  This allows for fresh and innovative ideas to come into play.  The second, convergent thinking is more of a narrowing or filtering process of analyzing and judging the ideas to find the best ones to use in relation to the task at hand.  This is considered “in the box thinking.” (Smartstorming-blog.com, 2010)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When mind mapping, both divergent and convergent thinking are used as well in creating maps.  Mind mapping allows you to brain dump all your ideas on the map initially and then, after, be able to evaluate and organize which ideas to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;method&quot;&gt;6-3-5 Method&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a method of brainstorming that usually involves three or more people. The group is given a form and asked to provide three ideas for solving a problem in five minutes. Participants are invited to consider out-of-the-box ideas and to combine ideas with others. The ideas are written in silence to prevent participants from influencing each other. After the first five minutes, each participant passes a form like the one below to the adjacent participant, who then reviews the ideas and adds new ones. (Wilson, 2013)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;six-thinking-hats&quot;&gt;Six Thinking Hats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘Six thinking hats’ is a creative problem solving technique used to come up with decisions from a number of different perspectives. This decision making technique forces the user to move outside their usual thinking style, allowing them to get a more rounded view of a situation (Mindtools.com, 2014).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique can be used in meetings or by an individual. Used in a meeting it can benefit the group by allowing people with different thinking styles to unify their ideas and stick to one thinking style.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Identifying Problems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Using the research we did previously, we created a mind map using coloured sticky notes. We did this after reading up on Conánn FitzPatrick’s ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://conann.com/creative-problem-solving/410-inspire.html&quot;&gt;Inspire&lt;/a&gt;’ post, where he discussed about creating whitespace and definining themes using the notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent roughly thirty minutes coming up with different ideas shown below in figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/projectblog/img/posts/identifying-problems.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Sticky notes&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headings were;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If so what are they?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How are they performing?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Should we stand on the shoulders of giants?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What would a completed new offering look, sound, taste, smell or feel like.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are their strengths and weaknesses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Blog Feedback #02</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I recieved my second blog feedback from Clair Stevenson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;source src=&quot;/projectblog/downloads/blog_audio_feedback_02.mp3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I need to do;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add proper references to images&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refine and add to the ‘Composition of Wed Design’ post&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refine ‘Competitor Research’ post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’ve done;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve written about Negative Space and added image references in the &lt;a href=&quot;/projectblog/kreative/2014/10/16/composition-in-web-design&quot;&gt;Composition of Web Design&lt;/a&gt; (11/11/14)&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Competitor Research</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I and my teammates will be conducting our own individual research into competitor websites for our client. Mark Boulton said that research is vital to the success of any design solution and I totally agree with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;indeedhttpindeedcouk&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indeed.co.uk&quot;&gt;Indeed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/projectblog/img/posts/indeed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Indeed&quot; title=&quot;Indeed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed is a job search engine website, clearly demonstrating their focus is on delivering the best search results to users no matter where they are. The site is similar to Google in terms of opting for functionality over visual design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design uses a lot of negative space, thus keep it clear and simple. The main colour of the website is blue, which, in colour psychology, is perceived to be a calm, soothing colour making the user feel relaxed. Even Mark Boulton states that a design which mostly consists of blue could be described as ‘cold’, ‘calm’ or ‘reserved’. Blue is also commonly associated with a lot of businesses such as Intel, Twitter, Samsung, Tesco, etc. Indeed also uses orange for highlighting certain words, for example when a job is available a text will show up stating a new job is available. This text is coloured orange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site doesn’t seem to use a strict grid system as the top navigation and the footer are full width, whereas the main body is constrained within a container which stays in the centre of the browser window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of typography, the site uses Arial, a san-serif font, as their primary typeface. This suits a website such as Indeed, as it easier to read on screen and allows the users to read the information much more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-experience&quot;&gt;User experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed aggregates job postings from thousands of sources and posts them on one site. Instead of visiting five or six different online job sites, Indeed brings the power of many into the power of one. This saves you lots of time in your job search. When you apply to a job on Indeed, you will most likely be redirected to another search site to apply. This can be slightly irritating, but it’s worth it for the efficiency gains from only having to search one job site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Indeed don’t use responsive web design, but they do provide their job search engine product as a dedicated iPhone, iPad, and Android app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;monsterhttpwwwmonstercouk&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monster.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/projectblog/img/posts/monster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Monster&quot; title=&quot;Monster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monster is a clean job search website, which keeps the search results neat - at first you only get the job title, company, location, and date when last updated, which is just what you need. Everything else about the purple-white UI, from the straightforward search window to the clean and easy-to-browse favourites, looks aesthetically pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-1&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Indeed, Monster seems to try and fill up most of the space of the website with content, all though the website still looks good. The primary colour of the site is purple, which is usually associated with royalty, wealth and money. I personally think this is an unusual colour scheme for a job board site even though in colour psychology it fits with the theme of the site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site has a fixed width of 994 pixels and is centred horizontally within the browser window. It doesn’t seem to use a strict grid system, but in some places it organised in columns, for example near the footer at the bottom there are 4 columns containing links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of typography, the site uses a san-serif font, most likely Arial. The site also has a distinguished type hierarchy, for example content links are coloured blue, headings are bold and black and links in the header a white with underlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-experience-1&quot;&gt;User Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monster offers useful, content-rich career resources to manage the job search and application process from start to finish. You can effortlessly shortlist favourite jobs and keep track of them, both within the app and through email alerts. The site can also retrieve a maximum of 250 job listings at a time, giving you plenty of options to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ni-job-finderhttpwwwnijobfindercouk&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nijobfinder.co.uk/&quot;&gt;NI Job Finder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/projectblog/img/posts/nijobfinder.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NI Job Finder&quot; title=&quot;NI Job Finder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NI Job Finder is Northern Ireland’s local job search engine. The sites search capability is simple, then lets you make it as detailed as you want. It provided complete control of the filter options. Date, relevance to keywords, company, education, and experience are just some of your options to generate a very targeted job search with the most relevant listings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-2&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the other two job boards, NI Job Finders seems to pack a lot of information onto their homepage. You have the search engine at the very top of the site, with an image on right side which adds a bit more colour to the site. The primary colour of the website is turquoise, which is also the main colour of the logo. The turquoise colour is also used as the background colour for the search engine and some headings. The website, Bourn Creative, said;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The color turquoise is associated with meanings of refreshing, feminine, calming, sophisticated, energy, wisdom, serenity, wholeness, creativity, emotional balance, good luck, spiritual grounding, friendship, love, joy, tranquility, patience, intuition, and loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The websites typography is very simple and uses a san-serif font. Again, san-serif fonts suit these types of websites as it is very modern and simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website seems to use some of sort of grid system, although it doesn’t seem that strict. There is too much information on the site, which can confuse the user and could lead them to leave the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-experience-2&quot;&gt;User Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mention before, the job search experience is quite user friendly. I was able to search jobs using various filters, thus allowing me to accurately find the right job for me. The amount of content on the homepage can be overwhelming for some people, but it doesn’t really affect the user experience too much. Unfortunately the website does respond to mobile devices and it does seem to have any kind of mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Composition in Web Design</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Composition is about how ideas and design elements are laid out into a whole, composing a design. It is arguably the most important part of a design process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good composition will boost the user experience when navigating through a website and will help create a better design overall. When creating composition, the designer should aim for alignment, consistency and strong unity. Composition also helps to add visual relevance to layouts so that it can help users to understand more about their journey on a website, where they should head next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/projectblog/img/posts/gomedia_composition_girl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Composition&quot; title=&quot;Composition&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A layout is the basis of a website. It brings different aspects of design into play and guides the user through each section and tells them what is most important. With different browser types, screen resolutions and sizes a designer needs to know what layout to use whether it is fixed, fluid or responsive. In this post I will talk about different aspects of layout used in web design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;space&quot;&gt;Space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is an important part of web design, but it’s also one of the most neglected and underrated. By being able to grasp control of negative/white space, we are able to create a subtle, but defining element of a webpage and make good use of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negative/white space is when an area of a design doesn’t demand our attention. Negative space plays an important role in any type of design work, especially in web design as it visually gives a resting place for the visitor. These resting places are often found in margins and the space around design elements (Boulton, 2007).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/projectblog/img/posts/squarespace_white-space_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Negative Space&quot; title=&quot;Negative/White Space&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of sites, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://squarespace.com&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; (see fig 2), use the minimalisim concept, which is to convey an idea or point using the least amount of visual noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If no negative space is present, there is nothing for site visitors to move their eyes to take a visual break. For example, if a visitor comes to a website and every inch of real estate on the screen is taken up by words, graphics, blinking things, etc., it starts to feel chaotic and makes the visitor feel uneasy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grid-systems&quot;&gt;Grid Systems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I’m working on website I use a grid system as they are crucial to good web design. Whether I’m using my own prebuilt, responsive, CSS-based grid system or designing around guides in Photoshop, grids provide structure and clarity to web design. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grids have been used for centuries in print design. They have helped rein in the chaos of the web as well—time was, web pages were built with lots of nested tables and spacer gifs. This was not the best solution, but once CSS became more popular and supported, designers were quick to use grids in their designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“When you add complexity, you can decrease usability and there is a danger the grid would become so complex the designer can’t use it.”&lt;/em&gt; - Boulton (Designing for the Web (Online, 2014), Chapter 5, Part 23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rule-of-thirds&quot;&gt;Rule of Thirds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was first made aware of the rule of thirds whilst working on my final GCSE art project. At first I didn’t think much of it, but once I saw it in practice I was simply amazed how it transformed the way I viewed art. The rules of thirds is commonly associated with art and photography, but it can also be applied to web design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule of thirds is a essentially a guideline that is used when creating designs, photographs, films and paintings. The rule of thirds uses a grid of 3x3, hence the name, which can placed on any design, photography and painting which can help the user to alter their work to make them more appealing to the viewer or audience. It is used to help balance designs and work and make them more interesting and eye catching to the viewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Golden Ratio is a grid system that helps designers/developers plan their websites or designs to help improve user satisfaction or appear more aesthetically pleasing to the human eye. The ratio does not strictly have to be similar to figure X above, it can be adapted. Twitter (as shown in figure X below) have flipped it to fit for their design and information to make it look better and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog feedback</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recieved feedback on my blog from Clair Stevenson in the form of an audio file, which you can have a listen to below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- ####Feedback --&gt;
&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;source src=&quot;/projectblog/downloads/blog_audio_feedback_01.mp3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with all that has been said about my blog. The work on this blog is not up to my usual standards and that is largely due to the lack of motivation and not treating my blog like an assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve now updated my blog with the &lt;a href=&quot;/projectblog/minutes/&quot;&gt;minutes&lt;/a&gt; and a link to the &lt;a href=&quot;/projectblog/downloads/Terms_of_Reference_Final.docx&quot;&gt;terms of reference&lt;/a&gt; and I am currently writing up an update on colours and typography in web design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ToR Feedback and More</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we received feedback on our Terms of Reference that we created for our client. The feedback was mostly positive and we received a very high mark for our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what &lt;em&gt;Clair Stevenson&lt;/em&gt;, our tutor, wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A design and technical challenge has been accepted by the team and by the live client with serious money by way of Wordpress templates being used. Careful planning considerations have already taken place with wireframes. Have adequate communication links been established between the team and client?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that we are falling short on communication between each other, but we’ll hopefully change this by incorporating team managment tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the Terms of Reference by &lt;a href=&quot;/projectblog/downloads/Terms_of_Reference_Final.docx&quot;&gt;clicking here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;role-changes&quot;&gt;Role Changes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the team lead role has been passed on to &lt;em&gt;Lauren McKimm&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
