Hi there! My name's Tajdid Rahman, but you can call me Taj. This blog was created for my Project Management module that I'm currently doing for my Foundation Degree Interactive Media course at the Belfast Met, Titanic Quarter.

I also have a design [portfolio](http://tajdidrahman.co.uk) and [twitter](http://twitter.com/tajdidr) profile.

And now I leave you with this gif of Jake from [Adventure Time](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1305826/)
