The Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995 aims to end the discrimination that faces many people with disabilities. This Act has been significantly extended, including by the Disability Discrimination (NI) Order 2006 (DDO). It now gives people with disabilities rights in the areas of:

- employment

- education

- access to goods, facilities and services, including larger private clubs and transport services

- buying or renting land or property, including making it easier for people with disabilities to rent property and for tenants to make disability-related adaptations

- functions of public bodies, for example issuing of licences

The legislation requires public bodies to promote equality of opportunity for people with disabilities. It also allows the government to set minimum standards so that people with disabilities can use public transport easily (Nidirect.gov.uk, 2015).
