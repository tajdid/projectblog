The ‘Six thinking hats’ is a technique used to come up with decisions from a number of different perspectives. This decision making technique forces the user to move outside their usual thinking style, allowing them to get a more rounded view of a situation (Mindtools.com, 2014).

This technique can be used in meetings or by an individual. Used in a meeting it can benefit the group by allowing people with different thinking styles to unify their ideas and stick to one thinking style.
