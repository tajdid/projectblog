Colours play an important role in all design mediums. Although the visual functionality of a website is influenced primarily by the text on the screen and page layout, colour takes it a step further by making a psychological impact (Irby, 2014).

Choosing the right colours when designing a website is something that requires a lot of patience, experimentation and guesswork.

>People make a subconscious judgment about a product in less than 90 seconds of viewing, and a majority of these people base that assessment on color alone. In fact, almost 85% of consumers cite color as the primary reason they buy a particular product, and 80% of people believe color increases brand recognition. (Gillett, 2014)
