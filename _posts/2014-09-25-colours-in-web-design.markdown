Colours play an important role in all design mediums. Although the visual functionality of a website is influenced primarily by the text on the screen and page layout, colour takes it a step further by making a psychological impact (Irby, 2014).

Mark Boulton reports that designing with colour in graphic design is the most difficult to get right (Boulton, 2014). I completely agree with this statement  as colour is very subjective. Some like a combination of green and blue, whereas some find it boring.

Choosing the right colours when designing a website is something that requires a lot of patience, experimentation and guesswork.

>People make a subconscious judgment about a product in less than 90 seconds of viewing, and a majority of these people base that assessment on color alone. In fact, almost 85% of consumers cite color as the primary reason they buy a particular product, and 80% of people believe color increases brand recognition. (Gillett, 2014)

Any professional web designer would be able to tell you that there are three properties to colour - hue, saturation and value;

- __Hue__ - what part of the spectrum the colour belongs to (such as red, yellow, pink, green, purple, orange or blue).
- __Saturation__ - how rich a hue is; neon colours, for example, are very saturated, whilst pastel ones are less so.
- __Value__ - how bright a color is; really, it is looking at how close it is to white or black.

The property that many people mistakenly use is the hue, as they tend to choose colors that clash together instead of flowing nice.

Just take a look at the colour wheel (figure 1) here. It looks nice and the colours flow perfectly into one another — so it goes without saying that visually, blue, and the colours to the left and right of it, blend nicely together. They’re called analogous colours.
