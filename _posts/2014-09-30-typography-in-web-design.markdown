Typography has an important role to play in helping convey information. The amount of typefaces available are few and far between, and with the introduction of web font services such as Typekit and Google Web Fonts the available fonts to the web has become easier than ever to implement.

A popular combination is to use serif fonts as the body of text and sans-serif fonts for the headings or vice-
versa. The body text should be easily readable with the heading fonts complementary and potentially playful. A general rule is to use no more than 2/3 typefaces on a website.

##Hierarchy

Creating a strong typography hierarchy is vital in all mediums of graphic design. It's a system used for organising type that allows a designer to establish an order of importance, thus allowing the user to easily view the information they're looking for and navigate the content.

One of the best ways of accomplishing typography hierarchy is by varying the type size to differentiate content. Although colour and layout is important, different type sizes, spread across a website, will speak louder to readers the importance of a pages elements. It also helps readers in a hurry to quickly pick out the important parts - which could also lead to the reader staying longer and reading on.

_Figure 1: Chapter 13, Hierarchy, Solving the design problem (Boulton, 2014)_

Figure 1 represents the relationship between Times New Roman's uppercase and lowercase typefaces and its weights. This is also known as a type family.

>“if a designer has set type in roman and they need to add emphasis to a certain point in the copy, they would follow the lines to any on the second lines – bold lower case, small caps, full caps, and italic lower case or sloped small caps. If they were to jump to, say, bold italic lower case, or a more extreme example, bold sloped caps, the effect would be horrible. If the designer is setting type in bold lower case they could go on to add bold caps, or bold italic lower case without much bother. ” - _Chapter 13, Hierarchy, Solving the design problem (Boulton, 2014)_

The above quote suggests that hierarchy can also be achieved by not only using different sizes of type to achieve it, but we can also use different styles; for example, all-caps, or using italic for sub-headings. As I mentioned before, serif and sans-serif typefaces can also be mixed to good effect.

##Swiss Style

I've always been a big fan of the swiss style, so I had to discuss the topic in my blog. The famous swiss style is often referred to as the International Typegraphic Style or just simply International Style. The style was formed in Switzerland back in the mid 1900s and was the basis of modern graphic design in the mid 20th century and remains so today. 

The term International Typographic Style came around due to the aim of the style, which is to be clean and improve readability in design, but the characteristics of the style also composes of sans-serif typefaces, asymmetrical layouts, grid systems and visual communication using photography with type.

>“Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to remove.”
- _Antoine de Saint-Exupéry_

[Josef Müller-Brockmann](http://www.designishistory.com/1940/joseph-mueller-brockmann/) was a leading pioneer of the Swiss style and was the founder and editor of the Zurich published journal Neue Grafik, who introduced the Swiss Style into America. He concerned himself with functional and objective design that by restricting design elements in the confine of a typographic grid, would shift the focus of image on the core message displayed by a clean and simple geometrical aesthetic. 

Other assoicated artists of Swiss design include the likes of;

###Swiss Style in Web Design

As the Swiss Style is devoted to the minimal elements of design such as typography and content rather than textures and illustrations. The impact of these styles on the web is that they are naturally very user-friendly interfaces, as any message is conveyed clearly, with minimal artistic clutter around it.
