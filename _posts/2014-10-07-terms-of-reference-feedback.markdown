Today we received feedback on our Terms of Reference that we created for our client. The feedback was mostly positive and we received a very high mark for our work.

>“A design and technical challenge has been accepted by the team and by the live client with serious money by way of Wordpress templates being used. Careful planning considerations have already taken place with wireframes. Have adequate communication links been established between the team and client?”

Also, today the team lead has changed to Lauren McKimm.
