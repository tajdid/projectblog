I designed the homepage design below using Adobe Photoshop. We didn't have any brand guidelines given to us, so I had the creative freedom to execute the design however I wanted. I decided to go with a black and green colour scheme. The black colour gives it a corporate theme and the green is meant to represent Northern Ireland.

I tried making the design modern by using a flat design style along with some stock photography that I found. I also used a san-serif font called Corbel, which has a very clean and modern look to it.
