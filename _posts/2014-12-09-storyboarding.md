I designed the homepage design below using Adobe Photoshop. We didn't have any brand guidelines given to us, so I had the creative freedom to execute the design however I wanted. I decided to go with a black and green colour scheme. The black colour gives it a corporate theme and the green is meant to represent Northern Ireland.

I tried putting focus on the content so I didn't use any gradients, but used photography along with some simple and clean typography.
