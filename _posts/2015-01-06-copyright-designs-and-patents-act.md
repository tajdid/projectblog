Copyright gives the creators of certain kinds of material, for instance music, images, books, video and software, rights to control ways their material can be used. These rights start as soon as the material is recorded in writing or in any other way. There is no official registration system (Bbc.co.uk, 2015). The rights cover:

- Copying;
- Adapting;
- Distributing;
- Communicating to the public by electronic transmission;
- Renting or lending copies to the public; and,
- Performing in public.

The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act has two main purposes (Teach-ict.com, 2015):

- To ensure people are rewarded for their endeavours
- To give protection to the copyright holder if someone tries to copy or steal their work.
