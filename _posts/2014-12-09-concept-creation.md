As a group we decided to create a wireframe of the homepage. We'll each be creating our own version of the homepage and we'll then be translating this into a pixel perfect mockup later using Adobe Photoshop.

I created the wireframe below using a program called [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/), which is great for user interface design.
