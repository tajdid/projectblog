Creative problem solving is a way of addressing an issue in a creative way. This technique allows us to think differently, excercise our minds, redefine the problem we're facing, find new ideas and then take suitable action.

##Divergent & Convergent Thinking
Divergent and Convergent are two types of thinking that are equally important in brainstorming and collaboration. The first, _divergent thinking_ is considered “thinking out the box” where the imagination runs wild and possibilities are endless.  This allows for fresh and innovative ideas to come into play.  The second, convergent thinking is more of a narrowing or filtering process of analyzing and judging the ideas to find the best ones to use in relation to the task at hand.  This is considered “in the box thinking.” (Smartstorming-blog.com, 2010)

When mind mapping, both divergent and convergent thinking are used as well in creating maps.  Mind mapping allows you to brain dump all your ideas on the map initially and then, after, be able to evaluate and organize which ideas to use.

##Six Thinking Hats

The ‘Six thinking hats’ is a creative problem solving technique used to come up with decisions from a number of different perspectives. This decision making technique forces the user to move outside their usual thinking style, allowing them to get a more rounded view of a situation (Mindtools.com, 2014).

This technique can be used in meetings or by an individual. Used in a meeting it can benefit the group by allowing people with different thinking styles to unify their ideas and stick to one thinking style.
