Creative problem solving is a way of addressing an issue in a creative way. This technique allows us to think differently, excercise our minds, redefine the problem we're facing, find new ideas and then take suitable action.

##Six Thinking Hats

The ‘Six thinking hats’ is a creative problem solving technique used to come up with decisions from a number of different perspectives. This decision making technique forces the user to move outside their usual thinking style, allowing them to get a more rounded view of a situation (Mindtools.com, 2014).

This technique can be used in meetings or by an individual. Used in a meeting it can benefit the group by allowing people with different thinking styles to unify their ideas and stick to one thinking style.
