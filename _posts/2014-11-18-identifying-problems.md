Using the research we did previously, we created a mind map using coloured sticky notes. We did this after reading up on Con√°nn FitzPatrick's '[Inspire](http://conann.com/creative-problem-solving/410-inspire.html)' post, where he discussed about creating whitespace and definining themes using the notes.

We spent roughly thirty minutes coming up with different ideas shown below in figure 1.

The headings were;

- If so what are they?
- How are they performing?
- Should we stand on the shoulders of giants?
- What would a completed new offering look, sound, taste, smell or feel like.
- What are their strengths and weaknesses?
