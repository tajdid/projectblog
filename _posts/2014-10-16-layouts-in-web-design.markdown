A layout is the basis of a website. It brings different aspects of design into play and guides the user through each section and tells them what is most important. With different browser types, screen resolutions and sizes a designer needs to know what layout to use whether it is fixed, fluid or responsive. In this post I will talk about different aspects of layout used in web design.

##Rule of Thirds

I was first made aware of the rule of thirds whilst working on my final GCSE art project. At first I didn't think much of it, but once I saw it in practice I was simply amazed how it transformed the way I viewed art. The rules of thirds is commonly associated with art and photography, but it can also be applied to web design.

The rule of thirds is a essentially a guideline that is used when creating designs, photographs, films and paintings. The rule of thirds uses a grid of 3x3, hence the name, which can placed on any design, photography and painting which can help the user to alter their work to make them more appealing to the viewer or audience. It is used to help balance designs and work and make them more interesting and eye catching to the viewer.

The Golden Ratio is a grid system that helps designers/developers plan their websites or designs to help improve user satisfaction or appear more aesthetically pleasing to the human eye. The ratio does not strictly have to be similar to figure X above, it can be adapted. Twitter (as shown in figure X below) have flipped it to fit for their design and information to make it look better and easy to use.
