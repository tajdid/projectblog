A layout is the basis of a website. It brings different aspects of design into play and guides the user through each section and tells them what is most important. With different browser types, screen resolutions and sizes a designer needs to know what layout to use whether it is fixed, fluid or responsive. In this post I will talk about different aspects of layout used in web design.

##Composition

##Spatial Relationships

##Grid Systems

##Golden Ratio
>_"The Golden Ratio is a beautifully simple piece of mathematical theory that can help make your designs feel well proportioned and pleasing on the eye."_ - Sam Hampton-Smith

The Golden Ratio is a grid system that helps designers/developers plan their websites or designs to help improve user satisfaction or appear more aesthetically pleasing to the human eye. The ratio does not strictly have to be similar to figure X above, it can be adapted. Twitter (as shown in figure X below) have flipped it to fit for their design and information to make it look better and easy to use.
